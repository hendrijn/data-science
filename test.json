          "bodyText": "Labour MP Ian Murray, shadow Scottish secretary, said while Boris Johnson was leaving whoever the next leader was had been “complicit in defending his shameful and corrupt behaviour”. “The people of this country will not forget that Tory MPs lined up time and time again to excuse the behaviour of a man caught lying and partying while the country was in lockdown, and defending sexual predators. “They clapped him out,” he said. Douglas Ross has meanwhile pledged to work with whoever wins the keys to Number 10, with the Scottish Conservative leader having described both candidates “fully up to the task of being our next prime minister”. The Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss has told Channel 4 News she is “entirely focused on a positive campaign” and plans to cut taxes if she beats Rishi Sunak to become the next prime minister. She added: “I can hit the ground running, I can get things done.” Political analyst Patrick Flynn believes tactical voting took place in the latest round of Conservative voting among MPs. Rishi Sunak v Liz Truss: all you need to know about the final two prime minister contenders. Plans have been announced to overhaul Border Force, as an independent review found it was performing at a “suboptimal level” and stretching its resources in an “unsustainable and highly inefficient way”. The independent review, commissioned by the home secretary, Priti Patel, to see how well it may respond to future challenges, said that, despite a “dedicated, capable workforce”, the agency seemed to be “less than the sum of its parts with significant systemic challenges”. The review, by the former Australian immigration minister Alexander Downer, said: “Overall, my impression of Border Force is an organisation which is performing at a suboptimal level. “It appears to be struggling to get out of a cycle of crisis management, reacting to the last challenge and bracing itself for the next, regardless of how predictable the next challenge may be. “Although Border Force is largely delivering what is required of it on a day-to-day basis, it does so by stretching its resources in an unsustainable and highly inefficient way.” The first of the 12 official public hustings organised by the Conservative party in the leadership contest has been set for July 28 in Leeds, before Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak tour the UK for questioning. A hustings for the Conservative Councillors’ Association, organised separately and believed to be taking place behind closed doors, is expected to take place on Thursday. Conservative members are expected to receive postal ballots by 5 August, with the ballot shutting at 5pm on 2 September ahead of the final announcement. The candidates will also attend hustings in Exeter, Eastbourne, Northern Ireland, Manchester and London during their tour. In two of the three Conservative leadership elections that got as far as a ballot of party members in recent decades, the candidate who won the most votes among MPs went on to win the members’ vote. The most recent example was in 2019, when the final ballot of MPs ended with Boris Johnson in front on 160 votes (51% of the total), while Jeremy Hunt won 77 (25%) and Michael Gove won 75 (24%). There was a similar pattern in 2005, where David Cameron came top of the final ballot of MPs with 90 votes (45%), followed by David Davis on 57 (29%) and Liam Fox on 51 (26%). The exception came in 2001, when Ken Clarke won the most votes among MPs but then lost the ballot of members to Iain Duncan Smith. The 2001 contest was notable for the close result of the final MPs ballot, in which Clarke won 59 votes (36%), Duncan Smith 54 (33%) and Michael Portillo 53 (32%). But Duncan Smith then won the members’ vote by 61% to Clarke’s 39%. Sir Iain Duncan Smith believes it would have been a “dereliction of duty” for foreign secretary Liz Truss, who he is backing for the Tory leadership, to resign from Boris Johnson’s government. Asked if she is the continuity candidate, the former Tory leader told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “No, Liz Truss is on her own record and what she wants to do, the truth is when you use words like ‘continuity’ they don’t really mean a huge amount. “Liz Truss stayed in the cabinet, she had a very important job, it was foreign secretary, we’ve got a war going on in Ukraine, and a serious crisis, it would’ve been a dereliction of duty for her to have abandoned it and then promptly decided to get rid of him. “The truth is she was straightforward and loyal on that, and I think that was the right way to be.” Sky News will host a live televised head-to-head debate between the final two candidates vying to be the next leader of the Conservative Party at 8pm on 4 August. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have both confirmed they will take part in the one-hour debate hosted by Kay Burley, with questions from a live studio audience. This will be a key juncture in the race, as Conservative party members receive their ballot papers the same week. Back to where we started this morning, and here is more reaction to Rishi Sunak’s announcement that he will maintain the ban on new onshore windfarms if he becomes PM. (See 9.17am.) This is from the Green MP Caroline Lucas. This is from Simon Evans from CarbonBrief. And this is from the veteran environment journalist Geoffrey Lean. He means electing, not decking, obviously. Tory infighting hasn’t got that bad yet. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is now taking over. Labour says Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are both “continuity candidates” and Boris Johnson stooges. In a statement on behalf of the party Conor McGinn, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: The choice to be the next Tory leader is down to the two continuity candidates. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are stooges of the Johnson administration whose fingerprints are all over the state the country finds itself in today. Both are now desperately trying to distance themselves from the Tory record of the last 12 years. But both have backed every decision, including every one of Boris Johnson’s 15 tax rises. Rather than plans to tackle the Tory cost-of-living crisis or grow Britain’s economy, they are simply offering the fantasy economics of unfunded giveaways. Neither offers working people anything except more of the same. The bookmakers have Liz Truss as the favourite to win the contest. Ladbrokes has Truss’s odds at 4/7, and Rishi Sunak at 11/8. Paddy Power has Truss at 8/15, and Sunak at 5/4. And Smarkets says the odds give Truss an implied 60% chance of winning. Patrick English from YouGov says his firm’s research suggests positive personality traits, followed by support for conventional Conservatism, will count the most when Tory members choose a new leader. A third cabinet minister has pulled out of an appearance before a House of Commons committee at short notice, PA Media reports. PA says: Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng had been due to answer questions this afternoon from the environmental audit committee on accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels and securing energy supplies. But Kwarteng wrote to the committee’s chairman, Philip Dunne, this morning to say he could no longer attend. The minister gave no reason for pulling out, but offered to rearrange for a date in September, after MPs return from their summer recess. Announcing Kwarteng’s decision, the committee tweeted: “He gives no explanation nor apology. This is not the way for senior ministers to treat scrutiny.” The government has already been accused of attempting to avoid scrutiny since Boris Johnson resigned as Conservative leader after two other cabinet ministers pulled out of select committee appearances. Home secretary Priti Patel pulled out of an appearance before the home affairs committee on 13 July, claiming “recent changes in government” meant she could no longer attend. The next day, justice secretary Dominic Raab cancelled his session with the joint committee on human rights, which was scheduled to question him on plans to replace the Human Rights Act with a bill of rights. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, has rejected claims his campaign lent votes to another candidate to force a rival out of the contest. Asked if he had been doing this, he replied: Absolutely not. As you can see from the results that have just been declared, this has been a really close contest. And I’m really humbled that I’ve made it to the next stage. I’m grateful to all my colleagues for their support. He dismissed suggestions that the campaign had been too negative. Asked if there had been too many blue-on-blue attacks, he replied: What we’ve seen is actually a debate about ideas, which is very healthy. And it’s good for us to debate ideas to make sure that we get the policies right for the country. And he restated his claim that only he could beat Labour. He said: The question now for our members is who is the best person to defeat Keir Starmer and the Labour party at the next election. I believe I am the only candidate who can do that. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser, has posted an extract from his Substack blog on Twitter explaining why he thinks Liz Truss is so unsuitable to be PM – and why he thinks Boris Johnson supporters her. According to a YouGov poll of Conservative party members yesterday, Liz Truss would beat Rishi Sunak by 54% to 35%. In the past YouGov polls of party members have provided a reasonably good guide to the outcome of internal elections. But these figures just reflect opinion in the party now (the fieldwork was carried out on Monday and Tuesday). Opinion can shift quickly (only a week ago party members thought Penny Mordaunt would make the best leader), although the Truss/Sunak figures have not shifted much over the past week. A week ago, YouGov polling had Truss beating Sunak by 59% to 35%. The ConservativeHome website has its own survey of Tory members and it has been conducted a similar exercise. On Sunday it published figures also showing Truss beating Sunak, but by a much tighter margin, 49% to 42%. Unlike YouGov, their figures also showed the gap closing significantly; a week previously, Truss was leading by 51% to to 34%. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, has released a video saying that he is “the only candidate” in the contest now who can beat Keir Starmer at the next election. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser, has just posted this about Liz Truss: Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has also released a message thanking her supporters. She goes on: I would also like to pay tribute to every candidate who stood for the leadership. Each of them has contributed enormously to the Conservative party and to public life. I am excited to now take to the country to make the case to the Conservative party about my bold new economic plan that will cut taxes, grow our economy and unleash the potential of everyone in our United Kingdom. As prime minister I would hit the ground running from day one, unite the party and govern in line with Conservative values. I am incredibly proud to be a part of the Conservative and Unionist party and am excited to spend the next few weeks proving to all of our brilliant members exactly why I am the right person to lead it, and our great nation. Penny Mordaunt, the international trade minister who has just been knocked out of the Tory leadership contest, has released a message thanking her supporters and calling for party unity. She said: I also want to congratulate both Rishi and Liz in getting through to the next stage. I pay tribute to anyone who puts themselves forward for such a demanding role. Politics isn’t easy. It can be a divisive and difficult place. We must all now work together to unify our party and focus on the job that needs to be done. I am a one nation, proud Brexiteer. My campaign put forward a positive vision for the country I love so much, remembering who we are here to serve. Our mission is not only to deliver on what we promised but to win the fight against Labour at the next general election. I hope to play my part in both. And this is from Liz Truss. She says she is ready to “hit the ground from day one”. She means “hit the ground running”, obviously. Things that hit the ground include people who trip, boxers who get knocked down and planes that crash. Penny Mordaunt has released this message on Twitter. It’s a call for unity – although technically wrong. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are going forward to the next phase, but Mordaunt isn’t. And here are the results again, showing how much each candidate has gained since yesterday. Rishi Sunak - 137 (up 19) Liz Truss - 113 (up 27) Penny Mordaunt - 105 (up 13) There were 59 Kemi Badenoch votes up for grabs after yesterday. These figures suggest Truss got almost half of them, but in the end she was only eight votes ahead of Mordaunt. And just over 30 votes separate Sunak, in first place, from Mordaunt, in third place. Broadly, the parliamentary party ended up splitting three ways. Brady said it would now be up to Conservative members to elect the party leader. The ballot will close on Friday 2 September, he said. And he said he would announce the results at 12.30pm on Monday 5 September. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, is reading out the results. Rishi Sunak - 137 Liz Truss - 113 Penny Mordaunt - 105 From the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope Penny Mordaunt’s supporters suspected the Liz Truss team were involved in the media attacks against her, James Forsyth from the Spectator says. The Daily Mail was particularly hostile to Mordaunt, although there was also a prominent, hostile article in the Sunday Times. (See 3.40pm.) Tom Newton Dunn from Talk TV is also picking up defeatism from the Penny Mordaunt camp. Liz Truss has just recorded a message for supporters, Adam Payne from Politics Home reports. The Penny Mordaunt camp are all but conceding defeat, the BBC’s Jonathan Blake reports. Penny Mordaunt’s supporters are nervous about their chances in the leadership contest, Sky’s Beth Rigby reports. The results of the fifth ballot will be announced at 4pm. Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, has agreed to launch a leak inquiry into the leak of government documents to the Sunday Times that were used to as the basis for a story undermining Penny Mordaunt’s claim that she never backed self-identification for trans people when she was equalities minister. The revelations were damaging to Mordaunt’s campaign for the Tory leadership. These are from the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope. Theresa May, the former prime minister, may have been the only Tory MP in the chamber not applauding Boris Johnson after PMQs. Shehab Khan from ITV has the clip. Gavin Williamson, the Tory former chief whip and Rishi Sunak supporter, has dismissed claims that he has been engaged in a secretive vote lending operation in the Tory leadership ballot, the i’s Arj Singh reports. Williamson was one of the key figures in the Boris Johnson campaign in 2019 and it is widely believed that, in that contest, he did allocate some of Johnson’s votes to Jeremy Hunt in the final ballot to ensure that Johnson faced Hunt in the members’ ballot, not Michael Gove, who was seen as a more formidable opponent. Gove was ahead of Hunt in the fourth ballot. But Hunt beat him by two votes in the final ballot for MPs. In this contest there have been numerous theories about what sort of vote lending strategies are in play. The rumour mill went into overdrive yesterday after the results came in because the departure of the (remain, leftish) Tom Tugendhat from the race led to an improbable 15 extra votes going to the (Brexity, rightwing) Liz Truss. Reporting on what might be happening, the Times says: One theory is that Sunak “lent” some of his supporters to Truss to force [Kemi] Badenoch out of the race. This, one Tugendhat supporter suggested, could explain why Sunak’s vote rose so little while Truss’s rose disproportionately. Another theory is that Brexiteers who had backed Badenoch over Truss in the third round moved back to support the foreign secretary amid fears that she could be pushed out altogether, putting [Penny] Mordaunt in pole position to get a place in the run-off. A third theory is that Badenoch was a potemkin candidate and that she and her most prominent backer Michael Gove will now declare for Sunak to give him the greatest momentum. The Daily Mail today splashes on an alternative theory: that the Sunak camp will be lending votes to Penny Mordaunt today, to force Truss out of the race. The Mail is strongly backing Truss. We will probably never be sure quite what is going on. But in 2019 Johnson had more than twice as many votes as any other candidate in every stage of the parliamentary ballot, meaning that he could easily afford to lend votes to someone else to knock out his most serious rival. In this contest Sunak’s lead is much narrower, making such tactics much more risky. But even if campaigns are not directing their most loyal supportes to vote tactically for someone else, individual MPs may well be voting tactically with the intention of knocking someone out. In these contests, stopping the person you most dislike becoming leader can be a stronger incentive for voting than getting your favourite elected. Eleni Courea makes this point well in today’s London Playbook. What is certainly true: There are both “stop Penny” and “stop Liz” crews eager to knock their least-desired candidate out of the running (as well as a “stop Rishi” crew camped inside No. 10). The big unknown of these parliamentary knock-out stages is how tactical voting by individual or small groups of MPs is influencing the final tallies. Playbook will say one thing: The margins in this contest are too narrow for Sunak’s team to try to play that game themselves without risk. “What you do have is MPs thinking who they could live with and backing them to move them into second place rather than vote for Rishi,” a Sunak campaign source tells the Times. “That is very dangerous freelancing. You only need 10 or 20 people to do that and Rishi is out of the final by accident.” At the post-PMQs No 10 briefing Boris Johnson’s press secretary responded to Keir Starmer’s claim that Johnson is a “complete bullshitter”. (See 11.57am.) The press secretary said: I would not respond with similar language of course. But I would disagree with that characterisation. I think the prime minister has delivered a huge amount that was promised to the British public, not least getting Brexit done, which was delivering on the will of millions of people. And [it’s] possibly slightly hypocritical of the leader of the opposition to say such things when he voted against doing that 48 times. Downing Street has said government departments will have to fund the public sector pay awards announced yesterday out of their existing budgets. At the post-PMQs briefing, the PM’s spokesperson said: There are no plans for the Treasury to provide additional resources beyond the £150bn increase in cash terms it’s providing over this parliament. Department spending is growing on average 3.7% in real terms each year which is the largest increase for any parliament this century. Asked whether this could mean cuts in other areas of departmental spending, the spokesperson replied: The NHS themselves will make clear that there will not be a need for further cuts or savings as a result of these decisions, so the NHS will be able to focus on some of the core issues in front of it. In a briefing this morning the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank said that, because the pay awards were higher than originally planned, government departments would have to make “painful cuts” elsewhere if their existing budgets were not increased. (See 11.37am.) Tobias Ellwood has had the Tory whip temporarily restored so he can vote in the leadership ballot today, the government has revealed. A government whips office spokesperson said: From the start of the leadership contest the whips office took a neutral position. After Tobias Ellwood MP failed to attend an important vote he had the Conservative party whip suspended. To ensure that the whips office neutrality in the leadership contest can not be questioned, the whip has been temporarily unsuspended from Tobias Ellwood MP. Upon the conclusion of today’s leadership contest, Tobias Ellwood MP will have the whip suspended. There were claims that Ellwood had the whip suspended because he was backing Penny Mordaunt rather than Liz Truss, who is seen as No 10’s preferred candidate. Sir Lindsay Hoyle said when he was elected Speaker that he would not let PMQs run for up to 40 or 50 minutes as his predecessor, John Bercow used to. However, this afternoon Hoyle made an exception to mark Boris Johnson’s final day at the dispatch box. Towards the end, after a long and often tedious session that mostly illuminated how threadbare Johnson’s legacy was, Hoyle must have been thinking it might have been better to pull the plug at 12.30 sharpish. But then, in his final answer, to Sir Edward Leigh, Johnson suddenly shifted gear and said something interesting. It was the political equivalent of his last will and testament, and it is worth reproducing in full. He said: I want to use the last few seconds to give some words of advice to my successor, whoever he or she may be. Number one: Stay close to the Americans, stick up for the Ukrainians, stick up for freedom and democracy everywhere. Cut taxes and deregulate wherever you can to make this the greatest place to live and invest, which it is. I love the Treasury but remember that if we’d always listened to the Treasury we wouldn’t have built the M25 or the Channel Tunnel. Focus on the road ahead but always remember to check the rear-view mirror. And remember, above all, it’s not Twitter that counts, it’s the people that sent us here. The last few years have been the greatest privilege of my life, and it is true that I helped to get the biggest Tory majority for 40 years, and a huge realignment in UK politics. We have transformed our politics and restored our national independence. We’ve helped, I’ve helped, get this country through a pandemic, and helped save another country from barbarism. And, frankly, that’s enough to be going on with. Mission largely accomplished – for now. I want to thank you, Mr Speaker, I want to thank all the wonderful staff of the House of Commons, I want to thank all my friends and colleagues, I want to thank my friend opposite, I want to thank everybody here, and hasta la vista, baby, thank you. Johnson shows little interest in introspection, and the speech he gave on Monday afternoon, at the opening of the debate on the motion of confidence in the government, was mostly a trite and unreliable catalogue of boasts. This afternoon’s statement was much more revealing, for three reasons. First, it is a useful guide to what Johnson’s political convictions actually are: Atlanticism, low taxes and deregulation – conventional Conservatism, in other words, leavened with support for big spending projects of the kind the Treasury dislikes. Levelling up didn’t get a mention, nor the environment. But his advice to politicians (focus on the future, and don’t take Twitter too seriously) was sound. Second, although Johnson has never publicly acknowledged that he was the cause of his own downfall, there was a hint here that his achievements have been limited. Listening to his speech on Monday, you would assume that his government was the most successful ever. But here he boiled it all down to: a big election victory, Brexit, getting through Covid, and Ukraine. “That’s enough to be going on with,” he added, suggesting there was much left undone. And that leads on to the third, and most interesting, feature of his valedictory: the very strong hint that he wants to stage a comeback. “Mission largely accomplished – for now,” he said. And he concluded with a line from Terminator 2 normally translated as “See you later.” Another line from the same film (and, more famously, in the first Terminator movie) is “I’ll be back.” The Tory applause for Johnson at the end seemed quite genuine, according to colleagues who were watching from the gallery. But that may just be a function of good manners, as much as anything else, and it doesn’t mean they want him to stay on. Keir Starmer did a good job at explaining quite what a mess Johnson had left his party in, and there is no evidence at all that the voters would welcome a second Johnson premiership. Britain has not seen an outgoing PM return to Downing Street after a period out of office for almost 50 years, since Harold Wilson in 1974. But, like his quasi US counterpart Donald Trump, Johnson is clearly mulling over the possibility of a comeback one day. It might not be the last PMQs after all. Supporters of Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt were locked in a frantic last-minute battle for votes this morning before the final parliamentary ballot opened. Two MPs backing Rishi Sunak told the Guardian they were expecting to face Liz Truss in the final ballot for party members. “I think she’s the one with the momentum,” one said. Another Sunak supporter said they thought the votes were seeing “significant churn” but added they thought it would be a mistake for campaigns to lend votes. “It’s all very unpredictable, I don’t think trying to stitch it up either way would necessarily help particularly,” Supporters of Sunak said they were hoping to see a new surge of votes for their candidate to give him momentum into the weekend. One MP said Sunak was a significantly better media performer than Truss which they hoped would give him the edge in the coming days. “We should be seeing his face everywhere as ballots start to land.” In Camp Mordaunt MPs were stressing to colleagues that they believed Mordaunt versus Sunak would be a “clean campaign” as opposed to Sunak versus Truss, which one said would be full “blue on blue” - pointing to the attacks they had directed against each other in the TV debates. MPs were punting out screenshots to colleagues showing Mordaunt’s electoral advantage. “I think even this morning we are seeing a swing away from Liz,” said one of Mordaunt’s campaign team. Sir Edward Leigh (Con) says he wants to thank Johnson for rolling out the vaccines, for delivering Brexit, for rolling out levelling up and for supporting Ukraine. “For true grit and determination, keep going.” Johnson thanks Leigh. And he says he has advice for his successor. Stay close to the Americans, stay close to the Ukrainians, and stick up for freedom, he says. He says he loves the Treasury, but if government had listened to them, it would never have built the M25. Do not listen to Twitter, he suggests. He says he got the country through the pandemic, and helped protect another country from barbarism. “Mission largely accomplished ... for now,” he says. “Hasta la vista, baby,” he ends. That’s a reference to this, from Terminator 2. And that’s it. Johnson gets a standing ovation as he leaves the chamber. Geraint Davies (Lab) says the PM will be remembered as a man of his word. “Pile them high” - 200,000 people died from Covid, he says. And he says people who took out student loans are now having to pay 7% ... Tory MPs are jeering. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, intervenes to get them to be quieter. Will the PM help people in need, Davies says. Johnson says students want a system where they do not pay back more than they borrow. And the government will get people into high-wage, high-skilled jobs, he says. He says Labour will let them languish on benefits. Anna Firth (Con) says the PM to back plans for a new hospital in Southend. Johnson says the case for this is being reviewed. John Nicolson (SNP) asks how many people will be ennobled in Johnson’s resignation honours list. Johnson says Nicolson will have to wait. Martin Vickers (Con) asks about a tariff on white fish, and the impact it is having on the seafood industry in his constituency. Johnson says he wants to encourage the fish and chip industry not to use Russian fish. Kirsten Oswald (SNP) says Brexit was imposed on Scotland against its wishes. Does the PM accept Scotland is a democracy. He has no right to stop it having the referendum it voted for. Johnson says the SNP is over-taxing to the tune of £900m. There was a referendum in 2014, he says. Ronnie Cowan (SNP) asks why Scotland should not have the chance to seek prosperity through independence. Johnson says the people of Scotland are supported by the massive fiscal firepower of the UK Treasury. Mark Francois (Con) thanks Johnson for the Northern Ireland legacy bill, saying it means veterans do not have to fear prosecution. Johnson thanks Francois for his campaigning on this. John McNally (SNP) asks if Johnson respects the right of the people of Scotland to self-determination. Johnson says he thinks there are more pressing issues for the people of Scotland. Crispin Blunt (Con) recalls the deadlock in parliament over Brexit in 2019. Does the PM understand why he has the gratitude of constituents who can spot the wood for the trees? Johnson thanks him for that. Claire Hanna (SDLP) says the government has broken trust in the Good Friday agreement. Anglo-Irish relations have been damaged too, she says. Does the PM have any regrets about his legacy? Johnson says he completely disagrees. Kate Osamor (Lab) says only one applicant in four has received compensation from the Windrush compensation scheme. Shouldn’t the scheme be taken out of Home Office control. Johnson says compensation payments have increased. And Labour has never apologised for the part it played in this scandal, he says. Andrew Bowie (Con) thanks Johnson for his commitment to Scotland. Does the PM agree that the UK will always be stronger together? Johnson says he could not have put it better himself. Johnson says it is “clearly insane” to take a disposable barbecue on to dry grass. Tony Lloyd (Lab) says people in the north do not think levelling up has achieved anything. Johnson disagrees, citing his northern rail plans. Jake Berry (Con) asks Johnson to urge his successors to maintain the levelling up agenda. Johnson agrees. He says levelling up is about equality of opportunity. Jamie Stone (Lib Dem) says wind power is crucial to the UK. Does the PM agree there should be a green freeport in the Highlands? Johnson says two new green freeports will be funded in Scotland. That could not happen if the SNP took Scotland back into the EU, he says. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says we look forward to Johnson finishing his book on Shakespeare, so we can find out what he thinks about tragic figures brought down by their flaws. Does the PM agree his successor should call an election. Johnson says Davey is like Polonius (the longwinded bore in Hamlet). He says if there were an election, the Lib Dems would get thrashed, because people would read their policies. Marco Longhi (Con) says when he was a pilot, he used to rely on team. The PM should set his compass for Dudley, where he will always get a warm welcome. Johnson says he has spent happy days in Dudely, and hopes there are more to come. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says Brexit has slashed £31bn from the economy. The growth forecast is the worst outside Russia, and inflation is at its highest for 40 years. He thanks Johnson for increasing support for Scottish independence. Johnson rattles out positive achievements. In Scotland schools are not what they should be because of the SNP. And the Scottish government is not dealing with the drugs problem, he says. Blackford accuses the Tories of showing disdain for Scotland. The PM is a rule breaker, partying through the pandemic, illegally proroguing parliament, and handing out contracts to cronies. He says the PM and his government should have had their last day a long time ago. Johnson says, with regard to Blackford’s personal abuse, he is talking “a load of tosh”. H hopes Blackford reflects on the wisdom of breaking up the best country in the world. Rob Roberts, the former Tory MP who is now an independent, attacks Labour’s record on the NHS in Wales. Johnson says he wants devolution to work. But the devolved administrations need to do their job properly. Starmer says the government got us into this mess, but do not know how to get out if it. What message does it send when the candidates for PM cannot say a single decent thing about his, each other or their record in government? Johnson asks what it says about Labour that people cannot name a single policy they have, apart from putting up taxes. Starmer is like one of those “pointless, plastic bollards”. The government will legislate to curb the impact of strikes. He says Starmer does that pointless flapping gesture because the unions are pulling his strings. Starmer says the public needs to know what the candidates think. He says Kemi Badenoch warned Rishi Sunak that the Covid loan scheme was subject to fraud. That cost the taxpayer £17bn. Is she telling the truth? Johnson says this is the last blast from “Captain Hindsight”. Labour said the government should get PPE from a costume company. The government got PPE quickly. Labour is economically illiterate and would wreck the economy, he says. Starmer says he is going to miss Johnson’s “delusion”. He says Truss said Sunak’s plans would cause recession, and Penny Mordaunt said public services were in a desperate strait. Who has been running the government for 12 years? Johnson says what matters to people is getting appointments, ambulance times etc. That is why the government passed the health and social care levy. Labour opposed it. Starmer is a “great, pointless human bollard”. Starmer says all his spending pledges are costed. The Tory candidates have made unfunded pledges worth £330bn. Does the PM agree with Liz Truss that, if Rishi Sunak has a plan for growth, we should have seen it already? Johnson praises the way the government responded to the pandemic. There have been tax cuts, he says. He says under Labour families on low incomes get most of their income from benefits. Under the Tories, most of it comes from work, he claims. Starmer says he is impressed Johnson could get through that with a straight face. Disaster struck when the public heard from the candidates. Does the PM agree with Rishi Sunak that the plans of his opponents are “fantasy economics?” Johnson says Labour knows all about “fantasy economics”. Labour has committed to unfunded spending pledges of more than £90bn. He says unemployment is very low. Keir Starmer says the relationship between a PM and a leader of the opposition is not easy. But he would like to wish the PM and his family the best for the future. He asks why the Tory leadership candidates decided to pull out of the Sky debate last night. Johnson says he is “not following this thing particularly closely”, but he thinks the public have had ample opportunity already to view the talent. “Like some household detergent”, they would wipe the floor with the opposition. He says a year ago lockdown was lifted. Starmer said it was reckless, he says. Luke Evans (Con) asks about Johnson’s assessment of Nato. Johnson says the accession of Finland and Sweden to Nato will make it stronger. Kim Leadbeater (Lab) says MPs can reflect on the seven principles of public life. But trust in politicians is at an all time low. Will the PM reflect on why that is, and what advice would he give to MPs? Tory MPs start jeering half way through. Johnson says he will be using the next few weeks to drive forward his agenda, which Labour fears – uniting and levelling up. That is why the Tories will win again, he says. Boris Johnson praises the work of firefighters. And he wishes the Lionesses the best for their match this evening. This will certainly be his last PMQs “from this despatch box, or any other dispatch box”, he says. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, notes this is likely to be Boris Johnson’s last PMQs. He wishes Johnson and his family the best for the future. We have been through many dark times in this house, including during the pandemic, he says. Johnson’s leadership during that period will be remembered, he says. Hoyle urges MPs to conduct themselves in a respectful manner today. From the Sun’s Kate Ferguson From the BBC’s Peter Saull Keir Starmer has given an interview to The Rest is Politics, the podcast hosted by Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications chief, and Rory Stewart, the former Tory cabinet minister. Perhaps because the presence of Campbell reminded him of Malcolm Tucker, Starmer got all sweary when asked for his assessment of Boris Johnson. He said: He is a complete bullshitter, and I think he’s been found out ... In the local elections there was a general realisation that this guy bullshits, if he’s bullshitting about that [Partygate], he’s probably bullshitting about everything. We’re unlikely to get language like that at PMQs, Boris Johnson is taking PMQs at 12pm. With the Commons starting its summer recess tomorrow, and the winner of the Tory leadership election due to be announced when parliament returns on Monday 5 September, this will be Johnson’s last time doing these exchanges. We suspect he hoped he would not be here. Last week he implied that for some reason he might be absent this week. But he’s here. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. In an analysis of the yesterday’s public sector pay awards published this morning, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank says the new prime minister will have to decide whether to increase departmental spending budgets, to fund the higher-than-expected pay awards, or to require the awards to be funded from existing budgets, requiring cuts elsewhere. It says: One option is to top up spending plans to at least partially fund the costs of higher-than-expected pay awards, shoring up departments’ ability to deliver on the government’s public service objectives (such as clearing the NHS backlog). This would come at the cost of higher borrowing and reduced fiscal room for the tax cuts seemingly desired by the entire field of would-be prime ministers. The other option is to stick to existing spending plans, instead requiring public services to make some painful cuts: to other budgets, to headcount, or to the range and quality of service provision. Reducing the government’s public services ‘offer’ is a coherent response to a series of global economic shocks that make us poorer as a nation. But the government should be honest about what that implies for the NHS, local government, and other public services. Penny Mordaunt, the international trade minister and Tory leadership candidate, has proposed a project to compose a new UK theme tune. She made the comment in an interview with the Spectator in which she paid tribute to the old UK theme (a medley of British tunes), which used to be played at the crack of down on Radio 4 until it was replaced by a news broadcast. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, has described Rishi Sunak’s promise to maintain the ban on new onshore windfarms as “economic illiteracy”. He said: As Britain boils in an unprecedented heatwave, it is economic illiteracy and unilateral economic disarmament in the fight against the climate crisis that Rishi Sunak wants to keep the ban on onshore wind. Anyone with such dangerous views is not a serious candidate for high office. But this is the reality: a Conservative leadership race in which candidates have engaged in fantasy climate denial that will lead to higher energy bills, damage our security and burdens future generations with extreme weather events. My colleague Peter Walker has more on the reaction to Sunak’s promise in his story here. Robert Colvile, the Sunday Times columnist and head of the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, says he is baffled by Rishi Sunak’s pledge to ban onshore windfarms (see 9.17am) – because Tory voters are mostly in favour of them. Colvile co-wrote the Conservative party manifesto in 2019 with Rachel Wolf. She also thinks the Sunak announcement is a mistake. Damian Green, the former first secretary of state and chair of the One Nation Conservatives group, has endorsed Penny Mordaunt for leader. Previously he was backing Tom Tugendhat. Green said: I have thought long and hard about what to do in today’s leadership ballot and I will be voting for Penny Mordaunt. She offers a fresh start and a chance to unify the party and deliver for the country. Simon Clarke was doing the morning interview round for the government this morning. He was ostensibly speaking in his capacity as chief secretary to the Treasury (in which capacity he backs the government’s tax policies, including the national insurance increase), but he was also answering questions as a supporter of Liz Truss’s leadership campaign (which believes the national insurance increase was a mistake). Understandably, at time this was confusing. Here are the main points from his interviews. Clarke suggested that, if Truss became leader, the government might abandon some of its current spending plans. He told LBC [Rishi Sunak] was delivering against the spending plans set out by the current prime minister, Boris Johnson. Those spending plans do not automatically need to be the case under a new prime minister. That will be my crucial difference with Rishi. I don’t believe those plans should be regarded as set in stone. With a new leader come new choices, and Liz has set out very clearly the things that she would prioritise, which includes tax cuts. I think that must be right. Clarke refused to say whether he had told Sunak that he disagreed with the national insurance increase. Speaking on the Today programme, Clarke pointed out that he only became chief secretary to the Treasury after that increase had been agreed. Asked if he had told Sunak he thought it was a mistake, he said: “We are bound by collective responsibility.” He claimed he was not being inconsistent in backing one tax policy as a Treasury minister, while also backing an alternative approach as a supporter of the Truss campaign. The election of a new leader would allow policy to change, he said: We are right on the cusp of electing a new leader of the Conservative party and prime minister and it will be for that leader to make new choices. Liz is clear, if she is elected there will be a new spending review, which will take effect from day one. I believe it is absolutely the case with a new leader comes new choices. He said he was backing Truss for leader because she had an “exciting plan for growth”. He said: I think she has the most exciting plan for economic growth and she set out a compelling plan to lower the burden of taxation. I have very high regard for Rishi Sunak. I am here to make the case for what I think is the right future step in terms of where we go from here and that is for a government led by Liz Truss. He defended the decision to remove the whip from Tobias Ellwood for missing the confidence vote on Monday (see 9.45am), saying that Ellwood made a “very serious mistake”. Clarke explained: He was in Moldova, rather than Ukraine. He was not on government work, he is a backbench MP. He defended the decision to offer public sector workers below-inflation pay awards. He said: It is crucially important, when setting public sector pay for the people who do so much hard work for our society, that we strike the right balance between managing the risk of worsening inflation, of baking it in and making it worse by setting very high pay deals while also looking after our workforce, and obviously the offer that is being made to the public sector has to be seen in the context of that £37bn package of support which is designed to help family incomes. He said today’s inflation figure was “very fractionally higher” than had been expected. Penny Mordaunt seemed to be telling Tory MPs this morning they would “murder” the Conservative party if they voted for one of her rivals. She posted a message on Twitter saying “Tory MPs – vote for Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss today and you’ll murder the party you love”, although the tweet has now been deleted. In fact, Mordaunt was just quoting the headline on a Daily Telegraph column that she is tweeting. It’s by Allison Pearson, and in it she says “it is Mordaunt, the Royal Navy reservist and centrist, who can unite our divided country and, most crucially, prevent a Tory wipe-out at the next election.” Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee who had the whip removed for missing Monday’s confidence vote, told Sky News this morning that his party risked “a long spell in opposition” because of the infighting taking place. He said: The nation wants to be impressed and inspired, not demoralised, by what they’re witnessing right now. And we need to perhaps exhibit greater decorum, dial the temperature down a bit, showcase the ideas, the vision, focus on those things that are important, that the nation wants to see. That’s what will earn us the right to stay in government otherwise, we’re just going to be letting ourselves down and indeed committing ourselves to probably a long spell in opposition. Ellwood missed the vote because he could not return in time from a visit to Moldova. He said that he was sorry he could not get to the Commons in time, and that he kept the whips’ office informed of his situation. “There were a problems with travel,” he said. “I am very sorry I didn’t make it back.” The removal of the whip means Ellwood can no longer vote in the parliamentary ballot for the Tory leadership, and Ellwood refused to comment on speculation that he was penalised because he is backing Penny Mordaunt, not the de facto No 10 candidate, Liz Truss. Explaining why he did not want to comment, he said: I’d be then fuelling the blue-on-blue [attacks], which I’m actually trying to avoid. Let’s focus on how we can move forward and make sure that we conclude this leadership campaign to the highest professional standard that I think the British people want to see. Rising petrol and diesel prices for motorists and dearer food pushed Britain’s annual inflation rate to a fresh 40-year high of 9.4% last month, my colleague Larry Elliott reports. Good morning. Boris Johnson will take PMQs for the last time as prime minister at 12pm, and an hour later Conservative MPs will start voting in what should be the last parliamentary leadership ballot. At 4pm we should know who the two candidates will be on the ballot for party members. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is almost certain to be on it, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, is likely to be there too, but Penny Mordaunt, the international trade secretary, has been in second place in all four previous ballots and she has a chance too. All three candidates are making last-minute appeals to Tory MPs. Sunak has promised to maintain the rules that in effect ban new onshore windfarms in England. He made the pledge as he promised that he would also set a new “energy sovereignty” target for 2045, so that at that point the UK produces as much energy as it uses. Sunak said: I am committed to net zero by 2050, but that can’t mean neglecting our energy security. So although the legal target for energy sovereignty will be 2045 and I will work night and day to ensure we beat that target, securing a safer future for the next generation. Wind energy will be an important part of our strategy, but I want to reassure communities that as prime minister I would scrap plans to relax the ban on onshore wind in England, instead focusing on building more turbines offshore. David Cameron’s government stopped the creation of new onshore windfarms in England by excluding them from subsidies available for other forms of renewable energy and tightening the planning laws, making it easier for communities to block developments. Johnson’s government has floated the prospect of lifting these restrictions. Although onshore wind is a cheap form of renewable energy, the turbines are particularly unpopular with activists in Tory constituencies. Truss has said that she will lead “a government of all the talents” if she becomes PM. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, in which she restates her commitment to reversing the national insurance rise and temporarily suspending the green levy on energy bill, she says: As prime minister, I would unite the party and lead a government of all the talents that includes the best and brightest from across the Conservatives. The quality of candidates that have taken part in this leadership race reflects how healthy our party is and how alive with ideas it remains. This implies MPs from all wings of the party could be included in her government. Truss’s supporters are also been reviving suggestions that Mordaunt is not experienced enough to be PM. Simon Clarke, a Truss supporter and chief secretary to the Treasury, said one reason why he was supporting Truss was that she was ready for the job “on day one”. Mordaunt has insisted that she is the only candidate offering “a genuine fresh start’. A source from her campaign team told journalists. Today is about continuity vs change for the Conservative party. Penny’s been speaking with colleagues already this morning and so many of Tom and Kemi’s backers are calling out for change. As the only one not in Johnson’s cabinet, Penny is the sole MP left in the race who offers a genuine fresh start. Not every candidate would win an election, but time and time again the polls show that Penny is the candidate Labour fear the most. MPs have a choice today - the same old or a new start for the Conservative party. Their colleagues, party members, and voters across the country are crying out for something new but only Penny Mordaunt can deliver that. Here is the agenda for the day. 12pm: Boris Johnson takes PMQs for the last time as prime minister, facing Keir Starmer. After 12.45pm: MPs begin the final day’s debate on the Northern Ireland protocol bill. 1pm: Conservative MPs start voting in the fifth parliamentary ballot for the party leadership. And it should be the final one, unless there is a draw, in which case a further ballot would take place. The ballot closes at 3pm. 4pm: Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, announces the results of the ballot - which should produce the names of the two candidates who will be on the final ballot for party members. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com"

          "bodyText": "The campaign team of Liz Truss say it was “never in doubt” that she would get to the run-off in the leadership vote. But many would have preferred to see her overtake Penny Mordaunt on Tuesday this week, and had had some expectations that it would happen. The result in the end was closer than either Truss or Rishi Sunak would have liked – and it became the most unpredictable leadership race in a generation. Truss will have huge cause to celebrate, coming from third to now the bookies’ favourite to be next UK prime minister. Since the race began, Truss has declined all broadcast interviews, apart from the debates, focusing on honing her message to MPs. She convinced a new generation of “red wall” MPs that she could be the standard bearer for Brexit, showing her commitment to the cause with evidence of trade deals signed and the Northern Ireland protocol bill. For more experienced MPs it was her credibility of years in cabinet, at the Treasury and the Foreign Office, with the economy and Ukraine at the forefront of MPs’ minds. Her team have been laser-focused on finding out what MPs care most about and on briefing her on their concerns. Many of those she already knows; Truss has always prioritised outreach to her parliamentary colleagues, holding surgeries in the tea rooms and hosting “fizz with Liz” (a term that has become legendary in SW1 but which her allies say she has never used). Allies of Truss believe some of Mordaunt’s early support quietly came over to them in the past few days, speculating that their rival’s leadership campaign had sewn up names many months ago who then started to have doubts when the race began. There has been endless speculation about the 4D chess being played by candidates – wild rumours of Sunak lending votes to knock out Mordaunt, Michael Gove working to split the right by backing Kemi Badenoch, centrist MPs mobilising to “stop Liz”. If these operations were taking place – and the churn in the vote suggests some probably were – then they almost certainly ended up cancelling each other out. The unpredictability of the race – and the duplicity of the electorate – made the final hours of the last round of MPs’ voting a stressful time for Truss in particular. But she did have the advantage of Tuesday night’s result, which knocked out Badenoch. Truss’s team were fishing for votes in an easier pool, with her having positioned herself as the flagbearer of the right of the party. Badenoch did not back anyone, telling her supporters in a WhatsApp message: “I know you will follow your heart and do what is best for us all, the party and the country.” It is clear now that a significant number decided to back the foreign secretary. It casts doubt on the most popular Westminster rumour of the last week, that Badenoch’s campaign was an astroturf construction masterminded by Gove, which would swing behind Sunak and give him credibility on the right in time for the members’ vote. Sunak has five former chief whips backing his campaign who know how to do the numbers. But, broadly, MPs are able to make up their own minds to vote tactically without much organisation, though they may not succeed. One supporter of another defeated candidate had said on Tuesday they would turn to backing Mordaunt’s campaign. Asked why they were rejecting Sunak, the person replied: “I haven’t, we just need to stop Liz.” That move turned out to have come too late."

          "bodyText": "The January 6 committee will hold its last scheduled hearing tomorrow, though its investigation continues. The Guardian’s Hugo Lowell reports on the latest development in the Secret Service’s allegedly accidental deletion of text messages from the time of the attack: The Secret Service turned over just one text message to the House January 6 committee on Tuesday, in response to a subpoena compelling the production of all communications from the day before and the day of the US Capitol attack, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The Secret Service told the panel the single text was the only message responsive to the subpoena, the sources said, and while the agency vowed to conduct a forensic search for any other text or phone records, it indicated such messages were likely to prove irrecoverable. House investigators also learned that the texts were seemingly lost as part of an agency-wide reset of phones on 27 January 2021, the sources said – 11 days after Congress first requested the communications and two days after agents were reminded to back up their phones. A bipartisan group of senators has just announced a deal to reform the procedure for counting electoral votes in order to prevent the sort of meddling that former president Donald Trump tried to pull off on January 6. The lawmakers have agreed to two bills that would reform the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which governs how electoral votes are counted following a presidential election. Citing ambiguities in the law, Trump and his attorneys pushed his vice president Mike Pence to disrupt the counting of electoral votes that showed he lost the 2020 election, sparking calls for the 135-year-old law to be reformed. “Through numerous meetings and debates among our colleagues as well as conversations with a wide variety of election experts and legal scholars, we have developed legislation that establishes clear guidelines for our system of certifying and counting electoral votes for President and Vice President. We urge our colleagues in both parties to support these simple, commonsense reforms,” the group of 16 senators said in a joint statement. The first bill is called the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, and would fix ambiguities in the existing law while clarifying when an incoming administration can access federal resources. The Enhanced Election Security and Protection Act is the second proposal, and would up criminal penalties against people convicted of intimidating or threatening candidates, voters and poll workers, require election records to be preserved, help the US Postal Service deal with mail-in ballots and reauthorize for five years a commission that works with states to improve their voting practices. “The prospect of large-scale violence in the near future is entirely plausible,” warns a new study that looks into the chances of political violence. Ed Pilkington digs into it: One in five adults in the United States, equivalent to about 50 million people, believe that political violence is justified at least in some circumstances, a new mega-survey has found. A team of medical and public health scientists at the University of California, Davis enlisted the opinions of almost 9,000 people across the country to explore how far willingness to engage in political violence now goes. They discovered that mistrust and alienation from democratic institutions have reached such a peak that substantial minorities of the American people now endorse violence as a means towards political ends. “The prospect of large-scale violence in the near future is entirely plausible,” the scientists warn. A hardcore rump of the US population, the survey recorded – amounting to 3% or by extrapolation 7 million people – believe that political violence is usually or always justified. Almost one in four of the respondents – equivalent to more than 60 million Americans – could conceive of violence being justified “to preserve an American way of life based on western European traditions”. Most alarmingly, 7.1% said they would be willing to kill a person to advance an important political goal. The UC Davis team points out that, extrapolated to US society at large, that is the equivalent of 18 million Americans. John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor and Democratic candidate for US Senate, has said he has “nothing to hide” about his health after suffering a stroke, and expressed confidence he can beat the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz in a race key to deciding control of the chamber in November. “I would never be in this if we were not absolutely, 100% able to run fully and to win — and we believe that we are,” Fetterman told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in his first interview since suffering the stroke in May. The Post-Gazette reports: “Mr Fetterman, 52, said he has ‘no physical limits’, walks four to five miles every day in 90-degree heat, understands words properly and hasn’t lost any of his memory. He struggles with hearing sometimes, he said, and may ‘miss a word’ or ‘slur two together’, but he said it doesn’t happen often and that he’s working with a speech therapist.” Fetterman enjoys consistent poll leads over Oz and has dramatically outraised him, despite Oz attracting the endorsement of Donald Trump. You can read the interview here. Pete Buttigieg fended off a Republican who used a transportation hearing to ask if Joe Biden’s cabinet had discussed using the 25th amendment to remove the president from office, saying: “I’m glad to have a president who can ride a bicycle.” The transportation secretary was appearing in front of the House transportation committee on Tuesday. Amid discussion of policy, the Texas representative Troy Nehls decided to go in a more partisan direction. “We now see the mainstream media questioning President Biden’s mental state, and for good reason,” Nehls said. “Sadly, he shakes hands with ghosts and imaginary people, and he falls off bicycles. Even at the White House Easter celebration, the Easter Bunny had to guide him back into his safe place.” Aides stood behind Nehls, showing blown-up pictures. Biden, 79, fell off his bike in Delaware last month, to considerable glee on the right. He told reporters: “I’m good.” But with the president beset by domestic and international crises, some compared his awkward moment with one in 1979, when Jimmy Carter, who would turn out to be a one-term Democratic president, was attacked by a rabbit while fishing from a boat. Nehls asked: “Have you spoken to cabinet members about implementing the 25th amendment on President Biden?” Buttigieg, a keen cyclist himself, said: “First of all, I’m glad to have a president who can ride a bicycle. And, I will look beyond the insulting nature of that question and make clear to you that the president of the United States …” Nehls interrupted. Buttigieg said, “Of course not,” then said Biden was “as vigorous a colleague or boss as I have ever had the pleasure of working with”. We’re expecting a major speech from Joe Biden soon on his efforts to fight climate change, which Congress lacks the votes to deal with. That doesn’t mean lawmakers aren’t busy; they’ve heard an address from Ukraine’s first lady asking for more weapons to fight off the Russians, and senators are weighing a bill to codify same-sex and interracial marriage rights. Here’s what has happened today so far: Rudy Giuliani, an attorney to former president Donald Trump, has lost his appeal against a subpoena from a Georgia grand jury. Trump called a top Republican lawmaker in Wisconsin recently and pressed him to decertify the results of the 2020 election in the state. Rusty Bowers, the speaker of Arizona’s House of Representatives who spoke to the January 6 committee last month, has been kicked out of the Republican party. Former president Donald Trump’s legal adviser Rudy Giuliani will have to talk to a Georgia grand jury sometime next month after his legal challenge against a subpoena failed, the Associated Press reports. Earlier this month, the grand jury in Fulton county, which includes Atlanta, subpoenaed Giuliani and other members of Trump’s legal team as part of their probe into his campaign’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state, where voters chose Joe Biden. Giuliani challenged the subpoena, but as the AP reports, he didn’t seem to put much effort into the appeal, failing to show up for a court hearing where he could explain why he shouldn’t have to testify. The grand jury has also summoned Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, who has been challenging his subpoena. Getting the Respect for Marriage Act through the Democratic-led House of Representatives is one thing, but could it pass the Senate? From what reporters on Capitol Hill are saying today, it doesn’t seem impossible. The bill won the votes of all Democrats as well as 47 Republicans when it passed Congress’s lower chamber yesterday. Assuming Democrats unanimously support it in the Senate, it would need the support of 10 Republicans to overcome the inevitable filibuster blocking its passage. According to CNN, several Republican senators have already said they’d vote for it: Congress is working on a lot of bills at the moment as the Democratic majority tries to make the most of the time remaining before November’s midterm elections, in which they could lose control of one or both chambers. Yesterday, Lois Beckett reports that the House passed a measure to codify same-sex and interracial marriage rights - which are currently protected by a supreme court ruling that could be overturned: The US House has passed a bill protecting the right to same-sex and interracial marriages, a vote that comes amid concerns that the supreme court’s overturning of Roe v Wade could jeopardize other rights. Forty-seven House Republicans supported the legislation, called the Respect for Marriage Act, including some who have publicly apologized for their past opposition to gay marriage. But more than three-quarters of House Republicans voted against the bill, with some claiming it was a “political charade”. All 220 House Democrats supported the bill, which is expected to be blocked by Republican opposition in a politically divided Senate. Zelenska concluded her remarks by describing the Russian invasion as terrorism, and linking it to America’s experiences with such attacks. “America unfortunately knows from its own experience what terrorist attacks are and has always sought to defeat terrorism. Help us to stop this terror against Ukrainians, and this will be our joint great victory in the name of life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness of every person, every family,” Zelenska said. “This is what I’m asking for and what my husband is asking for, not as a presidential couple but as parents and children of their parents. Because we want every father and every mother to be able to tell their child, go to sleep peacefully, there will be no more airstrikes, no more missile strikes. Is this too much to wish for?” Lawmakers in the room applauded as she finished her speech. Speaking through an interpreter, Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska told the stories of Ukrainians killed by Russia’s ongoing invasion, and appealed for more weapons from the United States. “The war is not over. The terror continues, and I appeal to all of you, on behalf of those who were killed, on behalf of those people who lost their arms and legs, on behalf of those who are still alive and well and those who wait for their families to come back from the front,” Zelenska said. “I’m asking for weapons, weapons that could not be used to wage a war on somebody else’s land, but to protect one’s home and the right to live a life in them. I’ve asked for air defense systems in order for rockets... not to kill children in their strollers, in order for rockets not to destroy children’s homes and kill entire families.” Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska is now addressing House and Senate lawmakers in Washington. The event has gotten underway, and you can watch it on the live feed embedded above. Viewers of the January 6 committee’s hearings - and followers of Arizona state politics - will remember Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the house of representatives in the southwest state who told lawmakers last month about Donald Trump’s efforts to get him to overturn state’s election results in 2020. Yesterday, the state Republican party kicked him out, though not, on its surface, for anything having to do with the January 6 inquiry. Rather, the party cited as the reason Bowers’ opposition to various bills in the state legislature and collaboration with Democrats. Here’s their full statement: Bowers appears to know the deck is stacked against him. In an interview with NBC News this week, he said of his current re-election campaign: “If I pull this off, it’s going to be a miracle.” The 2020 presidential election was held 624 days ago, but a top Republican in Wisconsin said Donald Trump last week encouraged him to decertify the results of the polls in the state, which Biden won by a narrow margin. Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, told Milwaukee broadcaster WISN that the former president called him and urged him to use a recent state supreme court ruling that ballot drop boxes are illegal to overturn the election results. “The court case as you read it does not go back and say what happened in 2020 was illegal,” Vos told WISN. “It just says going forward it can’t happen.” The speaker described the phone call as, “He makes his case, which I respect. He would like us to do something different in Wisconsin. I explained it’s not allowed under the constitution. He has a different opinion, and then he put out the tweet. So that’s it.” Trump didn’t exactly tweet, since he’s banned from Twitter, but he did take to his Truth Social platform and attack Vos as a “RINO” or Republican In Name Only, who let Democrats “get away with murder.” The former president could go further. Vos is facing a primary challenge from another Republican, but Trump hasn’t announced an endorsement in the race - yet. The climate crisis has reached the point where some of the fastest-growing American cities are increasingly uninhabitable, Oliver Milman reports: The ferocious heatwave that is gripping much of the US south and west has highlighted an uncomfortable, ominous trend – people are continuing to flock to the cities that risk becoming unlivable due to the climate crisis. Some of the fastest-growing cities in the US are among those currently being roasted by record temperatures that are baking the more than 100 million Americans under some sort of extreme heat warning. More than a dozen wildfires are engulfing areas from Texas to California and Alaska, with electricity blackouts feared for places where the grid is coming under severe strain. San Antonio, Texas, which added more to its population than any other US city in the year to July 2021, has already had more than a dozen days over 100F this summer and hit 104F on Tuesday. Victoria Bekiempis has more on the heat wave that’s striking the United States this week: More than 100 million Americans are under either a heat warning about dangerous conditions or heat advisories amid record temperatures, as 85 major wildfires burn in 13 US states, scorching more than 3m acres. Officials said on Tuesday that 14 new large fires were reported: seven in Texas, two in Alaska and two in Washington, as well as one each in Arizona, California and Idaho. More than 6,800 wild-land firefighters, and other support staff, were deployed to fires across the US. The sprawling blazes spread as record-high temperatures are poised to continue this week, leaving more than 100 million US residents under “excessive [heat] warnings or heat advisories”, the National Weather Service said Tuesday morning. Nine Democratic senators have today written Biden a letter urging him to declare a climate crisis immediately, which they say would give the executive branch extraordinary powers to lower America’s carbon emissions. The letter comes ahead of Biden’s speech this afternoon where he’s expected to announce executive orders to fight climate change, but not declare an emergency. “For too long, we have been waiting for a single piece of legislation, and a single Senate vote, to take bold action on our climate crisis,” wrote the group of senators, which includes former presidential contenders Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren. “We urge you to put us on an emergency footing and aggressively use your executive powers to address the climate crisis, create good-paying union jobs in the United States, and liberate hard-working American families from volatile energy prices.” They call on Biden to use powers under the National Emergency Act (NEA) to “immediately pursue an array of regulatory and administrative actions to slash emissions, protect public health, support national and energy security, and improve our air and water quality.” Here’s more from the letter: Declaring the climate crisis a national emergency under the NEA would unlock powers to rebuild a better economy with significant, concrete actions. Under the NEA, you could redirect spending to build out renewable energy systems on military bases, implement large-scale clean transportation solutions and finance distributed energy projects to boost climate resiliency. All of these actions would employ Americans in new and emerging industries while securing American leadership in global markets. Joe Biden is announcing his executive orders to fight climate change during a week in which much of America is facing scorching temperatures. The midwest is among the areas hardest hit: Massachusetts, where Biden will be speaking in the town of Somerset, is also not being spared: Biden hasn’t said yet exactly what steps he will take to cut America’s carbon emissions, other than that he’ll use presidential executive orders to do what Congress will not. He’s found no support among Republicans for his steps to fight climate change, and Democrats’ efforts to pass a bill unilaterally collapsed last week when Joe Manchin, a West Virginia senator with extensive ties to the energy industry, said he wouldn’t take part in the effort. Keep in mind that executive actions are frequent targets of litigation, and it would be no surprise if whatever Biden announces today gets taken to court - potentially even the supreme court, where conservatives are firmly in the majority and have shown a willingness to curb the government’s regulatory powers. Good morning, US politics live blog readers. After it became clear last week that he lacks the votes to get Congress to pass his proposals lowering US carbon emissions, President Joe Biden will head to Massachusetts today to announce new steps to tackle climate change - though he won’t declare an emergency, as some of his allies have called for. That’s not all that’s expected today: Expect to hear more about the Secret Service and its deletion of text messages following the January 6 insurrection. Last night, The Guardian reported the agency had turned over just one text message related to the insurrection that the House panel probing the attack sought. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, will address Congress at 11 am eastern time. The Senate judicary committee will at 10 am eastern time hold a hearing on preventing mass shootings that will feature testimony from the mayor of Highland Park, Illinois, where seven people were killed when a gunman opened fire at an Independence Day parade. Congress is considering a bunch of other bills, including a Democratic spending bill to lower prescription drug and health care costs, another to improve American technological competitiveness and a measure to codify same-sex marriage rights, which the House passed on Tuesday."

          "bodyText": "There has been no vision for a crisis-ridden society coming out of the race to be the next Tory leader. One is desperately needed. Patients are dying in ambulances queueing outside hospitals that are too full to accept patients. Greenhouse gas emissions are to blame for deadly heatwaves, but the government can’t spell out how it would meet its promise to cut them. Voters since 2010 have given the Conservatives the benefit of the doubt. The polls, and recent byelections, strongly suggest that the public are no longer inclined to do so. There is a palpable sense of the country being adrift. As the former Tory cabinet minister Michael Gove admitted earlier this week, under the Conservatives the core parts of government simply aren’t functioning any more. The new prime minister ought to be a clean break with the past. However, ballots of Conservative MPs have whittled the choice down to two contenders: the former chancellor Rishi Sunak and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. Both represent a continuation of Boris Johnson’s politics rather than a repudiation of them. There’s no sign that either will reverse the policy of increasing government control over opponents in parliament, in elections, in the courts and on the streets. This pair will slug it out over August for the support of Tory party members, who have the final say. The risk is that Britain ends up with a prime minister who is a mere cipher for the particular discontents and impulses of a section of a membership that is older, whiter, more southern and wealthier than the rest of the population. The country’s structural problems are afterthoughts in this contest so far. The government, meanwhile, is becoming unaccountable to parliament: bills are being pulled with little explanation; MPs are not being given proper time to scrutinise trade deals; and cabinet ministers are not bothering to turn up to select committee hearings. On immigration, Europe, nationalism and the environment, there’s little to distinguish between the frontrunners. Despite campaigning to stay in the EU in 2016, Ms Truss’s tax cuts and institutional disruption mark her out as the candidate of the Brexit right. As does her base in Lord Howard’s house, from which successive rightwing insurgents, including Mr Johnson, have launched their assaults on the Tory establishment. Brexit has unleashed a revolution that eats its own. Mr Sunak finds himself on the menu, a leave-backing Thatcherite who appears too leftwing for the Tory membership. But the main courses have been Conservative prime ministers who, like Shakespeare’s Henry IV, found that “uneasy lies the head that wears a crown” while their party is consumed by plotting. Put-downs and dirty tricks have made this campaign memorable. But they threaten a bitter resentment that is not easy to control; political careers have been consumed by it. If he wins, Mr Sunak would be the first non-white prime minister in Britain. Ms Truss, if successful, would be the country’s third female prime minister. Either would be an important moment for diversity. But this underscores the symbolic value of representation. Both candidates bear responsibility for the government’s substantial failure to remedy systemic inequality. Mr Johnson clearly favours Ms Truss. Her flaws are all too obvious, which is why – probably – she has the backing of Mr Johnson. The Tory party is choosing the country’s next prime minister. The Conservatives have a chance to provide a stable, competent government. Britain needs one."

          "bodyText": "Zoe Williams: At least the winner can’t distance themselves from the past 12 years I could always tell we’d miss Penny Mordaunt when she was out. No, just kidding. There was a sliver of danger, had she or Tom Tugendhat taken the leadership, that they’d make a plausible discontinuity argument, and all parties would walk into the next election as if the smouldering ruins of the past 12 years were no one’s fault. The injustice would have choked us. So it’s great to have avoided that. It leaves the Conservative members in a vexed place, though, since all the polls – both legitimate ones, and more on-the-hoof affairs – pointed to that being exactly what they wanted, a clean skin. Instead, they’re faced with Rishi Sunak, technocratic, bloodless, never likely to be racist enough, or Truss, presented as Boris Johnson’s “continuity” candidate. Which she is, in the sense that she remained loyal and didn’t resign. But when are political parties going to realise that members are not circuit boards, who can have their components infinitely replaced and still light up the same way? Truss will never be the next Johnson, because she will never give people the same feeling. She knows as much, which is why she keeps dressing up as Margaret Thatcher, but she’s nothing like her, either. So two candidates who look to the non-Conservative voter like genuinely eccentric propositions – an ex-chancellor so personally rich he reads like a walking conspiracy theory, a foreign secretary who communicates in lists of her own achievements – will read to the members like the most boring of the lot. I reckon Truss takes it, and I can’t wait. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Sahil Dutta: Neither offers any economic solutions Political parties have few organic links to the people they are supposed to represent. This is especially true of the Conservative party, whose members – overwhelmingly rich, old, white and male – will select the country’s next prime minister. It is maybe why the economic debate between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss seems so utterly removed from the reality of British capitalism today. Truss’s Britannia Unchained slogans about £30bn-worth of tax cuts and slashed “regulation” are a break from Treasury orthodoxy about government borrowing. But they are irrelevant to the country’s unsustainable energy system, soaring child and elderly care costs, falling real wages (for all but the 1%), or the outsized profits driving inflation. The UK is already an outlier for its low corporation, income and capital gains tax. How would further cuts transform living standards now, when they haven’t in decades? Sunak reheats Osbornite “pragmatism” on public borrowing. Yet while there is an immediate need to cut the cost of living by redistributing wealth and upgrading social infrastructure, there is no urgent necessity to cut the deficit. Long on slogans but short of substance, Truss can appeal to a membership base whose economic interests have long been secured. But for the broader UK population it is precisely that material security that is at stake. Sahil Dutta is a lecturer in political economy and co-author of Unprecedented: How Covid-19 Revealed the Politics of Our Economy Henry Hill: Sunak has time to win over party members This year’s Conservative leadership contest may be a first in modern times, in that the two candidates widely expected to reach the final two before it began have actually done so. Perhaps Rishi Sunak, having recorded the weakest first-place start in terms of vote share since the new rules were introduced after 1997, simply didn’t have the votes to spare to try to pick who made second place, as previous frontrunners have been accused of doing. But whatever the reason, we now know the rough shape of the contest: a fairly straightforward left-right clash between a high-tax fiscal conservative and a tax-cutting liberal. At present, Liz Truss is the favourite to win the second round; Conservative party members are not, in the main, well-disposed towards high taxes, even in aid of the impeccably Tory goal of not funding day-to-day spending by borrowing. But a month is plenty of time for the former chancellor to turn things around. The foreign secretary has not proved a strong campaigner so far, and her central proposition – that warmed-over Thatcherism is what will hold the “red wall” in 2024 – is dubious in the extreme. Sunak has his own problems, of course. His jibe at Truss in Sunday’s ITV debate was a serious misjudgment, given that millions of Tory voters are former Liberal Democrats and backed remain in 2016. But for now, he remains the candidate who seems more likely to reassure those voters that the Conservatives remain a sensible, acceptable option – and more than anything else, Tory activists want a winner. Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHome Moya Lothian-McLean: It’s hard to see Truss throwing this away Rishi Sunak has two months to convince the Conservative membership that they should mirror the support given to him by fellow MPs. The former chancellor may have won the most votes from colleagues in his leadership bid, but his opponent, Liz Truss is – at the time of writing – that bit more popular with the Tory base. It is they who ultimately get to decide the next prime minister of the UK. It’s difficult to see Truss throwing the contest within that time. Truss has already likely made any gaffe that would dash a counterpart’s chances. Truss is an “ideologue without ideas,” as John Crace put it. Domestically, her plans are incoherent and impossible. The one area Truss excels at is image-making; perhaps the UK can look forward to its first wannabe influencer-premier. Yet if Sunak does sway enough support, what lies in store seems to be the promise of austerity, repackaged as “fiscal responsibility”. The most pressing issue of our present – the climate – appears low on the radar for both candidates. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer and Labour reportedly smell an opportunity to get their own tepid show on the road, seeing a Truss or Sunak premiership as a death knell for Tory chances in the next election. It would be a fittingly uninspired end to this era of rock-and-a-hard-place politics. Moya Lothian-McLean is a contributing editor at Novara Media Simon Jenkins: It ought to be Sunak. It could well not be Welcome to act two of the tragedy of Boris Johnson. If polls of Tory members are to be believed, the next prime minister of the UK will be Liz Truss. Her limited experience of high office and the conduct of her leadership campaign are unedifying. They suggest a vain, cliched, pseudo-rightwing Tory, with no spark of charisma or originality. Her attempts to mimic Margaret Thatcher have been childishly embarrassing. The decision of Truss versus Rishi Sunak now goes to a bizarre “selectorate” of the Tory party members. As of 2017, their average age was 57. More than half are over 60 and more than 70% are male. They live predominantly in the south of England. That the nation’s leadership should hang on this tiny unrepresentative group is a perversion of parliamentary democracy. It has long stipulated that the government of the country should be led by the person who commands majority support of the House of Commons. That person is Sunak. He may also lack experience, but his performance at the Treasury during Johnson’s nightmare premiership suggests a man of sound judgment, caution and competence. He is the preference of most of his cabinet and MP colleagues as well as of opinion polls of the general public. He should be the next prime minister. Johnson, who reportedly told his supporters to vote for “anyone but Sunak” is driven by malice and devoid of public interest. The only hope now is for Sunak to rise above this wretched fray and convince his party that he is its best chance of leading the economy through a looming recession and keeping Labour from power in 2024. It is a tall order. The outlook is grim. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "Conservatives are braced for a “blue on blue dogfight” as Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss enter a six-week battle to become the UK’s next prime minister, with Penny Mordaunt’s supporters blaming hostile briefing for knocking her out of the race. The vote among MPs selecting the final two candidates saw Sunak retain his lead, with 137 votes. Truss, the foreign secretary who had trailed Mordaunt throughout the previous rounds, took 113 votes, just ahead of Mordaunt’s 105. Despite coming second among MPs, Truss is the favourite among Conservative party members, according to polling, with Sunak described as the underdog. About 160,000 fee-paying members – half aged over 60, 97% white and skewing male from southern England – will have the chance to vote next month to decide who will become prime minister in early September. Mordaunt had faced an intense media onslaught over issues including her stance on transgender rights, which one senior supporter said had cost her “a lot more than four votes” – enough MPs to clinch second place if they had swapped sides. Rival campaigns admit they expect a summer of difficult headlines for both Sunak, the Brexit-backing former chancellor, and Truss. A Tory source said Truss had managed to successfully cast herself as a champion of Brexit, including gaining the trust of “red wall” MPs, and claimed there was little awareness in the country – even among party members – that she initially voted remain. “Be under no illusions, that will be something that Rishi will need to attack hard and fast. He’s the underdog now and they fight dirtier.” Another Tory aide said Sunak should force Truss into as many TV appearances as possible. “The more people see of her, the more they will back Rishi,” they said. Loyal supporters of Mordaunt believe their candidate would have been able to fight a cleaner campaign against Sunak. One predicted “a blue on blue dogfight” between Sunak and Truss, and pointed to bruising exchanges revealing private cabinet discussions in two televised leaders’ debates over the past week. The pair will now face a vote by Tory members, with ballots due to arrive between 1 and 5 August, and the poll closing on 2 September. The winner succeeding Boris Johnson as prime minister will be announced three days later. Truss and Sunak have already clashed sharply over tax and spending policy, despite having served alongside each other in Johnson’s cabinet. Truss has claimed Sunak’s policy of delaying tax cuts risks plunging the UK into recession, while he has called her promises of unfunded cuts “socialist”. One Sunak supporter suggested the contenders would now adopt a more moderate tone as the contest reaches its final phase, with a dozen hustings scheduled throughout the summer. “Both of them will be very mindful that either of them could win, and if they win they will have to govern and try and bring the party together, and I think they’ll be both mindful that you’ve got to conduct yourself in a way where that is possible,” they said. But asked if Sunak would continue pointing out that Truss voted remain and was once a Liberal Democrat, or that her approach is socialist, the source said: “I don’t think they were attacks. What he actually said was the policies being suggested were socialist. It was a policy thing.” Both candidates served under Johnson for almost his entire term, with Labour saying the race was now between “two continuity candidates”. Conor McGinn, Labour’s deputy campaign coordinator, said: “Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are stooges of the Johnson administration whose fingerprints are all over the state the country finds itself in today.” On Monday evening, Truss and Sunak will face each other in a BBC debate. Hustings events are beginning even sooner, with one organised by the Conservative Councillors’ Association to take place in Westminster on Thursday morning. One Truss supporter said the foreign secretary had won a significant number of Kemi Badenoch’s backers over the course of the morning on Wednesday, after Badenoch was knocked out on Tuesday. “I think it wasn’t just the lack of experience, it was a real policy difference between Penny and Liz and ultimately people liked more of what they saw from Liz,” an MP said. Jonathan Gullis, one of the MPs elected in 2019, endorsed Truss on Tuesday morning. “Ultimately what won a lot of MPs over was her approach to Brexit, she showed the most enthusiasm and commitment and was prepared to talk toughest – that’s what voters in my constituency want,” he said. Mordaunt, who is a junior international trade minister but was never in Johnson’s cabinet, had positioned herself as an outsider offering the country a fresh start. At several points in the campaign she was the favourite, but Truss benefited by picking up votes from eliminated candidates on the right of the party, notably Badenoch. In a statement, Mordaunt congratulated the others but called on them to end the fighting. “Politics isn’t easy. It can be a divisive and difficult place. We must all now work together to unify our party and focus on the job that needs to be done,” she said. In her statement, Truss thanked MPs and said she would now “take the case to the Conservative party about my bold new economic plan” that would “cut taxes, grow our economy and unleash the potential of everyone in our United Kingdom”. She promised to “hit the ground running” as prime minister, a message initially tweeted as just “hit the ground” before being deleted. When the contest began, Sunak was the favourite despite the emergence in April of his wife’s non-domiciled tax status and his own possession of a US green card for a period when he was chancellor. He topped the MPs’ vote in every round, and always seemed likely to progress. By contrast, Truss’s supporters will view her last-minute overtaking of Mordaunt as a sign her momentum could propel her into No 10. The foreign secretary’s campaign began slowly, hampered by a somewhat wooden style and mixed performances in TV debates."

          "bodyText": "Sri Lanka’s prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been elected as president to replace the ousted Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a result that is likely to provoke turmoil among protesters who have been calling for weeks for him to resign. Wickremesinghe, who has been prime minister six times but never president, won a comfortable victory in parliament on Wednesday morning, where MPs voted for the new president in an unprecedented secret ballot. The vote came after protesters forced Rajapaksa from office amid anger over a spiralling economic crisis. Wickremesinghe, who comes from an old political lineage, faces a tough road ahead as Sri Lanka continues to be crippled by the worst economic crisis since independence, with shortages of food and fuel, and also grapples with a deep crisis of trust in parliament. Wickremesinghe’s election follows a dramatic week in Sri Lanka, during which Rajapaksa was toppled after his offices and presidential palace were stormed by thousands of protesters, who jumped in his pool and worked out in his gym. Amid the anger, Rajapaksa was forced to flee to Singapore via the Maldives and his resignation was formally announced last Friday. This was the first time in Sri Lanka’s history that a sitting president has been toppled midterm by a mass protest movement There has been fierce resistance and protests on the streets against a Wickremesinghe presidency. Though he had offered to resign as protests engulfed the streets last week, he did not, and instead accepted the role of acting president after Rajapaksa stepped down. Many fear Wickremesinghe will protect the Rajapaksas from being held accountable, as he has been accused of doing in the past, and would not instigate the constitutional change being demanded by the protest movement, including an end to the system of executive presidency. “I am disappointed but not surprised by this result because our politicians have repeatedly shown that they are more concerned about protecting the Rajapaksa cartel than doing what’s right for the country,” said Harini Fernando, 37, a social entrepreneur who was among those who joined a rally against Wickremesinghe on Wednesday afternoon. “Ranil has bent the constitution like a pretzel in order to make sure he can retain power. This proves, once again, that our politicians don’t stand for real democracy.” In recent days, Wickremesinghe, who declared a state of emergency this week, had made statements calling protesters “fascists” and indicating he would not be afraid to crack down on the demonstrations . Less than an hour after he was declared president, a court order was issued prohibiting anyone from congregating within a 50-metre radius of a statue that stands at Galle Face in Colombo, where anti-government protesters have been camped out for months. Speaking to reporters outside a Buddhist temple he was visiting on Wednesday afternoon, Wickremesinghe made it clear he would not tolerate those he perceived to be stirring up violence. “If you try to topple the government, occupy the president’s office and the prime minister’s office, that is not democracy; it is against the law,” he said. “We will deal with them firmly according to the law. We will not allow a minority of protesters to suppress the aspirations of the silent majority clamouring for a change in the political system.” However, people defied the order and dozens gathered on the steps of the president’s offices, which are still occupied by the protest movement, to shout rallying cries of “deal Ranil” – a reference to Wickremesinghe’s reputation as a scheming politician – as well as “Ranil bank robber”, referring to a bank bond scam he was implicated in. Hundreds of police and military stood on the periphery but did not interfere in the rally. Father Jeevantha Peiris, a Catholic priest who has been a protest leader, said that “parliament today have taken a decision against the people’s will” and emphasised that peaceful protest would continue until Wickremesinghe resigned. “The people of Sri Lanka wanted a just system, a democratic system, but we know Ranil Wickremesinghe was brought in by the Rajapaksa regime to cover up their brutal system,” he added. Wickremesinghe, 73, won the election with backing of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party (SLPP), which has the most seats in parliament. He was seen as the candidate favoured by the Rajapaksa family, who despite no longer being in power have significant influence over the party they formed. Wickremesinghe beat competition from another SLPP MP, Dullas Alahapperuma, who was part of a breakaway group and who had formed a coalition with the major opposition parties. However, it appeared that in the vote most of the ruling party MPs had rallied behind Wickremesinghe and secured his victory with 134 votes out of 219, while Alahapperuma got just 82. In a speech after his victory was declared, Wickremesinghe asked opposition parties to work with him. “I need not tell you the status our country is in. Now that the election is over we have to end this division. We had 48 hours to stay divided but from now on I am ready to have a dialogue with you,” he said. Present in the parliamentary chamber for the vote were three members of the Rajapaksa family who remain MPs, including Gotabaya’s older brother, the former president and prime minister Mahinda. It was the first public outing for the family since Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to flee the country. Wickremesinghe has more than four decades of experience in politics and has pitched himself as an experienced and capable pair of hands to guide Sri Lanka through its worst political and economic crisis in its history, and in particular help the country negotiate a critical bailout from the International Monetary Fund. However, his legitimacy among voters has been tainted by his close relationship to the Rajapaksa family, and many have accused him of having no political legitimacy or mandate, as he was appointed into the prime minister role by Gotabaya Rajapaksa and has little support among voters. Wickremesinghe is due to serve for the rest of Rajapaksa’s term, until November 2024. However, there are concerns his election signals an unstable future for Sri Lankan politics, with protesters vowing to unseat him just as they did Rajapaksa. “Ranil will be chased away, he is a crook and he doesn’t have a mandate,” said Anura Goonaratna, 53, a toy exporter. “This protest movement is going to get worse. There has to be an end to this and the only ending we will accept is throwing Ranil out, whatever it takes.”"

          "bodyText": "There is much that Boris Johnson will miss when he finally leaves Downing Street in September but having to face the weekly music at prime minister’s questions is unlikely to be on the list. The PMQs experience has frequently been a bruising one for Johnson, who has never been keen on being held to account and much less subjected to the forensic questioning of an opposition leader who honed his interview techniques as former head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Here are some of Johnson’s memorable moments at PMQs. In his first PMQs, Johnson swore in parliament, describing Labour’s economic plans as “s**t or bust”. During a session, he called Jeremy Corbyn a “chlorinated chicken”, faced down a rousing speech and demands for an apology from Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi about Johnson’s “racist” comments and had to be stopped from leaving too early ahead of his own spending review. Johnson grimaced his way through his first PMQs after he survived a bruising confidence vote in July as he was told he was “loathed” by his own party, called a “lame duck” and likened to Monty Python’s black knight who claimed his mortal injuries were just “flesh wounds” in the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. After the surprise resignations of cabinet ministers Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid in June, Johnson bore the humiliation of being told 10 times in 30 minutes that he had to go. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, told him he was haemorrhaging MPs so fast that it was like “sinking ships fleeing the rat” but the calls for his resignation didn’t come only from Labour MPs, with the most memorable line coming from the Conservative David Davis, who called for Johnson to do the “honourable thing” before it “becomes impossible for the government to do its proper job”. Boris Johnson was put in his place by the Commons’ Speaker in November 2021 when he was told to sit down. “You may be the prime minister of this country but in this house, I’m in charge!” said Sir Lindsay Hoyle. “I’m not going to be challenged.” Johnson was attempting to avoid answering questions over former Tory MP Owen Paterson, a paid lobbyist for a company that won government contracts worth almost £600m without competition. Johnson lost his temper four times in PMQs in April and said Starmer was out of his “tiny mind”. Johnson was rattled over questions about the Partygate scandal and claims he criticised the BBC over its coverage of the war in Ukraine. Johnson accused Starmer of being in a “Dr Who timewarp” and described Labour as being “intellectually bankrupt” but not before one SNP MP was told off for calling Johnson a “Pinocchio prime minister”."

          "bodyText": "Penny Mordaunt supporter Tobias Ellwood has temporarily been given back the Conservative whip to allow him to vote in Wednesday’s critical final round of the leadership contest. The Bournemouth MP was disciplined on Tuesday after failing to vote in a motion of no confidence in the government on Monday evening, because he was in Moldova. Ellwood, who is chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, was on a fact-finding mission to the country, but did not have permission to skip Monday’s vote. As a result, he was stripped of the whip on Tuesday, preventing him from voting in the fourth ballot to narrow down candidates to be the next party leader. But amid predictions that Wednesday’s fifth and final round could be very close, Ellwood will be allowed to take part. Some of Mordaunt’s supporters had previously suggested the move to exclude him was an attempt to influence the result. A spokesperson for the whips’ office said: “To ensure that the whips’ office neutrality in the leadership contest can not be questioned, the whip has been temporarily unsuspended from Tobias Ellwood MP. “Upon the conclusion of today’s leadership contest, Tobias Ellwood MP will have the whip suspended.” Conservative MPs are being given two hours to choose between the three remaining candidates, Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, in a secret ballot, with the result due to be announced at 4pm. The final pair remaining will then go forward to a series of hustings being held around the country, as Tory party members prepare to make the final choice. Voting among members is expected to open in early August, with the result announced on 5 September. Mordaunt’s supporters are fighting for every last vote, with Truss deemed more likely to win over most of the 59 backers of Kemi Badenoch, the rightwing candidate who was eliminated on Tuesday. Badenoch repeatedly criticised Mordaunt’s stance on trans rights, accusing her of being misleading about her record as equalities minister. But Mordaunt’s backers have been stressing the fact that unlike Truss, she represents a fresh start. Sunak, the former chancellor, has been the frontrunner throughout the race, but as of Tuesday, had not secured the 120 votes necessary to secure a place in the final two. He and Truss clashed repeatedly over the Conservatives’ economic record in the two televised debates held so far, with Truss claiming Sunak’s tax increases risk sparking a recession, and Sunak saying her unfunded promises of tax cuts amount to “socialism”."
